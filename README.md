# Matplotlib-Challenge

1.	Mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin were observed to present a larger size tumor, whereas those treated with Capomulin and Ramicane present a smaller size tumor.
2.	Capomulin and Ramicane treatments present the lowest average of tumor volume with a 40.68 (mm3), with a standard deviation of 4.99 and sem at 0.32. Both drugs seem to present similar results.
3.	Drug Capomulin shows a decrease in tumor size over time per line chart.
4.	We show a correlation between the weight of a mouse and the tumor volume. There seems to be an increase in tumor size as the weight increases per scatter plot.
